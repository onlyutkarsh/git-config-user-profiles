# Git Config User Profiles

Ever wanted to use different username, email addresses, and signing key for your commits at work and for your personal repositories? While it is easy to do using `git config` command, this extension allows you to maintain different username, email, and signing key in named profiles and allows you to easily switch and apply to the repository you are working.

### Setting the profile selected to the repo
---
Once you select a profile, the status bar text changes to selected profile name [1 in image below]. 

> The icon might display a "warning" sign if the current repo is not using the username, email, and signing key selected.

If you want to apply the username, email, and signing key defined in the selected profile to the current repository, click on profile name in the status bar (e.g `Work` ) and then select `Yes, apply` in the dialog [2 image below].

Once the repository's username, email, and signing key are in sync, you might see a check icon confirming that repository config is in sync with the profile selected.
